# 'Exploring Immune Repertoire Characteristics and Convergence across Multiple Sclerosis Patients'

This repository holds the source code for analysing different characteristics of publicly available MS immuno-sequencing data.
The immune repertoire analyses include: 
- gene usage across MS and healthy patients all sequences or clonally expanded sequences
- gene usage between peripheral and CNS B-cells in MS patients
- differences in CDR3 length across MS and healthy patients
- CDR3 length comparison between peripheral and CNS B-cells in MS patients

Additionally, repertoires of 27 MS and 27 healthy individuals were investigated for convergent BCR sequences
- convergence analysis using Scoper (from Immcantation toolset)
- identification of BCRs enriched in MS patients
- characterisation of enriched sequences
